## 📊 Featured Projects

### [🌍 FX Exchange Rates Data Platform (AUD-Centric)](https://github.com/bijit-kundu/exchange-rates)
**Tools:** Python · GitHub Actions · BigQuery · Looker Studio  

A fully automated end-to-end foreign-exchange analytics platform developed to analyse how the Australian Dollar (AUD) moves against leading global currencies.
- The system ingests historical and daily exchange-rate data from [ExchangeRatesAPI](https://exchangeratesapi.io/), processes it through a Python ETL workflow, and loads curated fact and dimension tables into BigQuery.
- A scheduled GitHub Actions pipeline retrieves fresh data daily, normalizes JSON responses, regenerates calendar and currency dimensions, enriches records with Perth-timezone metadata, and performs incremental MERGE operations to maintain clean, deduplicated BigQuery tables.
- The platform also includes a public Looker Studio dashboard, powered by aggregated BigQuery views, showcasing detailed insights such as long-term AUD trends, daily movements, monthly averages, weekday patterns, and min–max–current rate summaries across major global currencies.
